## 🎮 About the Game
**Sereno** is a game developed for the **MadridCrea Game Jam** where you take part of the life of a Watchman *(Sereno)*, Serenos were an organised 
group of men, usually authorised by a state, government, city, or society, to deter criminal activity and provide law enforcement as well 
as traditionally perform the services of public safety, fire watch, crime prevention, crime detection, and recovery of stolen goods. 
Watchmen have existed since earliest recorded times in various guises throughout the world and were generally succeeded by the emergence 
of formally organised professional policing.  

But in this game you... will do the opposite?

Enter this little world and get deep into the history of our Sereno.
